			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I am an ICT graduate keeping hobby in professional landscape photography followed by wildlife, cityscape and astrophotography. I have always been fascinated by the natural world and capturing its beauty through the lens of my camera.
				 For the past 1 year, I have honed my skills in landscape and wildlife photography, capturing stunning images of scenic vistas and majestic animals in their natural habitats.
				My passion for photography has led me to travel to some of the most breathtaking locations around the world, allowing me to capture unique and memorable images that tell a story and evoke a sense of wonder in the viewer.
				 Whether I am patiently waiting for the perfect light to illuminate a mountain peak or stealthily approaching a wild animal for the perfect shot, photography has taught me patience, perseverance, and an appreciation for the world around us.
				
				 As an ICT graduate with a keen interest in web development, I have spent countless hours honing my skills in frontend design. I enjoy the challenge of creating visually stunning and
				  user-friendly interfaces that engage and delight users. From designing responsive layouts to optimizing website performance, 
				  I am passionate about every aspect of the frontend development process I stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
				   In my free time, I love experimenting with new design concepts and building prototypes to bring my ideas to life.</p>
